        I am prasanna devapujyula belongs to east godavari. speaking about my educational qualifications I am currently studying btech final year in the stream of Electronics and communications. I have cgpa of 8.11 until 6th semester and i have passed my +2 with the cgpa of 9.12 and my schooling cgpa was 10. Coming to my falimy background I belong to a middle class family. My father is tailor and my mother is a homemaker. I have an elder brother and he is currently preparing for a civils examination. I am very much interested in web development for that I am learning mernstack from past few weeks. I am also good at python programming. 
        I am a spiritual person so my hobbies include reading mythology books most of the time. Apart from that  listening music, reading books, surfing fashion websites, gardening and dancing. Coming to my strengths I am a soft hearted person and always believe in karma. My dictionary doesn't include revenge and jealousy. And my greatest weakness is I always try to see positive side even though the evil is clear cut.
