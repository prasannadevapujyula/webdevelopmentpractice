    <h2><u>HISTORY:</u></h2><br>
    <p>Microsoft is a multinational computer technology corporation. Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[1] Its current best-selling products are the Microsoft Windows operating system; Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity software; Xbox, a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; Bing, a line of search engines; and Microsoft Azure, a cloud services platform.[2]

        In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.
        
        As of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of US$86.83 Billion and 128,076 employees worldwide.[3] It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of software products for computing device</p>

    <h2><u>WORK SPACE:</u></h2>
    <P>Unlike some other big tech companies, Microsoft hasn’t been involved in as many scandals and controversies. It’s also not as frequently targeted by the media. Still, as a giant multinational corporation, employees and ex-employees say working there is like working at other huge tech companies.

        Microsoft provides excellent salaries and benefits, exciting work, and the chance to collaborate with very talented people. On the downside, employees say work-life balance isn’t great, and there’s a lot of office politics.</P>
